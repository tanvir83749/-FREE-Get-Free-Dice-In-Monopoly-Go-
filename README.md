Free dice links are great ways to get a few extra dice, however, be careful when following links that you don't know where they go to, or from dubious websites. Remember also, that free dice links don't last for long so expect them to expire within a week and not be usable.When you click a free dice link, what normally happens is that it will open an instance of your game, so do it from the device where you play Monopoly GO! and you'll get shown a screen that details your reward.

There are a ton of free dice links available in Monopoly GO, with new ones dropping nearly every day. I’ve compiled a list of them for you, which you can access below, but before you get started make sure that you’re on the device that you normally play the game on. Once you’ve clicked, you’ll end up in the Monopoly GO app, where you can claim your reward for doing nothing at all, which is very nice. Also, there is a chance that you may sometimes receive slightly different rewards than those listed below based on your player level.
If you’ve clicked on one of the above links and it’s not giving you your free dice or other reward, there are a few reasons that might be happening. Sometimes, those links have expired, and though we pull those down as fast as we can, it’s possible we’ve missed one or are asleep. The older a link is, the more likely it’s expired.
